This is to demostrate how to use a ML model in flask application.
This model takes two argumenst 'age' and 'gender' as input and predits what music the age group likes.
In this example we have same model generated by two deifferent libraries (pickle and joblib) in Jupiter.
We have demonstated how to load these tow models and use it in Flask


- Create venv if you don't have one:  $ python -m venv venv
- Activate venv : $ venv\Scripts\activate
- install requirements:
    $ pip install requirements.txt
- run flask app : python app.py
- Eg request and response : http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict?age=21&gender=1
- response :
        {
        "Joblib_prediction": [
            "HipHop"
        ],
        "Pickle_prediction": [
            "HipHop"
        ]
    }
