    - This company checks all sales related emails and telephone calls and catagories 
        the commom keywords used in a successful sale closure as well as un successful sales.
    - Example : 
        - what time is more suitable for email and telephone call for sale
        - what key word should use
        - should be men / women who can close most sales
        - what are the customers most queris about?
        - gives feed back on each call and email to improve it in the future.
        - based on previouse conversation it tells who should the sales rep should contact tomorrow.
        - * (start means my own feature) suggest to follow potential customer to close sale based on 
            previouse  conversation.
        - * creates tailored offers to the customer based on their conversation.


# Scale AI
    -   This company catagorise and lables the data from customer so that they can be grouped
    - extracts details form hand written documents evern in variouse langunage and converts into 
        digital data.
    - using sattlelite images they have identified nuumnber of buildings damaged during Russia Ukrain war.
    - In car insureance company, their AI analysis the claims and suggest the optimal solutions and 
        detects fraud based on locations, similarity, claim patterns, etc.
    - Theier algorithm evern explains why the particular decision is make and this is important 
        factor as well for making cretical business decisions.
    - For retailers like Sofa seller, they can upload a sofa image and the AI model can give different
        pics where the Sofa can be put for online catelogues and marketting. Reduces the Photograper costs.
    - Also creates content for given topic for adverdisement.
    - * Takes series of images of a product and analys for any anomaly, defects, classifications, 
        labelling, can filter un suitable data (eg phone with sun shine into)
    - They campare our model wtih other algorithms to evaluate it's performance and find optimal one. 

# https://www.turintech.ai/
    - customers uplodad a labeled data to this website, using the data visulaiser they can see the uploaded
        data and user can remove un wanted fileds from the data. the tool also automatically removes the fields automatically which is un useful during the data pre processing stage.
    - They offer to find best suitable model for the customers data. Customer can do it by them selfs and
        they can choose suitable model based on theri hardware needs suggested by the Turintech AI.
    - it will show how the model performans on different hardwares like intel amd, etc.
    - Basically, it generates ML code from your data.
    - You can also bring your own mdoel code or build on with them.
    - if your ML code is in effiecient, this can help you to optimise it for your need.
    - finally the use can download and use the model like you use in Python or you can use with 
        the api that Truintech provides for your model.
    - they also helps insurance company to give better price for customers by searching like "sarah, 30 years, AUDI, 2014" and the ML model gives best prices for this.
    - It recommonda personlalised product to the customers using their 'customerModel'. It will suggest what
        the customer will likely to buy.
    - fraduDetectionModel will allow to find fraduland insurace claims.

# https://wluper.com/use-cases
    - They basically use ML to report and track incidentes in a work place. for eg, if a air conditionor
        not working in a office, customer can simply describe the fault, location, and all relevant info
        by talking to the app. This will create a job instantly.
    - It is helpful for all industries and suitable for site inspection engineers.
    - can report faulty machines, safty issues, 
    - they use convesational AI. So user can report incidents by voice only.
    - example incident reports below:
        +   "The lift doors at the ground floor are not closing properly, but the lift still operates. 
                We should get Apex Lift Company to come in tomorrow morning and have a look."
        + " I have completed the building systems inspection for Building 12. Everything looks
                good apart from a leaking tap in the kitchen on the first floor. A plumber should visit by the end of the week."
        + "The filling machine was jammed. I located and removed the obstruction and the conveyor is 
            now running freely again. It took about 5 minutes to fix."
        + "The shift at zone 1 started at 6am and finished at 10am. There were 3 labourers onsite, 
                roadworks are now 75% complete. One subcontractor didn't wear a helmet on site. Please send a safety alert to Nick Hayes."

# https://rep-tec.co.uk/products/robotics
    - They us Vision AI in recycling industrie
    - using the robotic arms powerd by vision ai, it sorts the materials and removes un wanted materials.
    - they can catagorise 256 different items
    - provides actionable data and insights

# https://onyxinsight.com/condition-monitoring-software/
- it does predictive maintanance for wind mill turbains.
- For eg, it monitor's vibrations in a bearing, it's temperature for every 2 mins. it prints the data in
    time series chart and use can set alarm thresholds to notify. 
- in the dashboard, it will show you the wind mill layout with health wise color coded. if you click on
    any wind mill it will show the history of it's data and manintanace history.
- they also monitor weather data to predict it's production and can stop it before overloading.
- it shows statustics for past break donws, costs, major break down category, to reduce it or change the
    vendor.
- asset management. shows asset mainatanance history, next maintanance, etc.
- So basically their solutions are, predictive maintanace, performance analysis, cost optimisation

# https://www.infogrid.io/smart-cleaning
- Building managements using AI and Iot. monitors how a work space is being used and for how long
- air quality check
- Tells to clean the work space which is been used.
- tells cleanig creaw via message, toilet to clean based on the usage, office floors

# https://www.spot.ai
- spot.ai uses computer vision to detect objects in images.
- They have edge deivce connected to cctv and shows data in dashboard
- User can access the live video throug the dashboard from anywhere in the world
- But don't have the feature that you haave designed.
- You provide the hardware for free and charge for the usage of theri app
- They detect pepple, car, car waittime, any incidents, search, use can share the clip to any one,
