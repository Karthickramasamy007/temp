# DEFINE YOUR BUSINESS MODEL:

# PRODUCT
- Look what you did in Prrodapt to Vodafone and try to find easier way for Prodapt and Vodafone or any comp.
    * RCA, Outtage nofication, Alarm, ticket creation, device status, historic status check, live status check
        etc.
- Look what you do for LBG and try to improve the process for LBG for other companies.
- Also consider what are teh possible data for an imaginary company and work on it's solutions.

- You don't know the full business process and every business has different way of operations even
    if they are same sector. For eg, an insurance company will using different data
    labels to identify best price for the custoemr and another company will use differenct technique
    and parameters. So, when you develop a tool it should be generic and should be in a way to adpopt
    every customers.
- it should support to upload data set from different soruces like local, cloud, data base, json data, csv, docx, etc.
- Once the dataset is uploaded they user can able to edit and modify it if they wanted. Also, our tool should
    eleminate un useful features from the data set during auto pre processing phase.
- Based on the dataset provided by the customer, our tool should find the best algorithm for the data 
    based  on the purpose. Once trained it should evalulate the model effficiency baed on the evualuation method that the customer choosen. Finally, the model should be able to downloadable for the customer and also ablee to use with the api or they can deploy it on our own system to use it.
- Based on the dashboard data, it would be greate if it could generate document report with 
    data,       paragraph, logo, key point, etc for the user to present this in the meeting. the prduced document should also be editable (paragraph, images, not the data) if they want.
- Our production should be useful to monitor entire fleet level, specific shop or farm level, specific
    object or service in shop or farm.
- create a tree based chart while brain stroming your ideas of your services, who can view and use each services
- create some made up data using coding that resembles companies data to test your application and can
    be used for demo purposes.
- while creating product, create it's feature of basic user, pro user and premium  users.
- In your website and product video, enhance how your product helps businesses like improves quality, production rate, reduce costs, gives more control, predict future, improves safty, control in a one single place.
- Before starting product development considerr your infra architecture and product architecture.

- SERVICE1: [DATASET SERVICE]

- PRODUCT1 : [HIGHLT CUSTOMISABLE COMPUER VISION APPLICATION]
    - First we need to connect the live vide stream at the users location to our edge device
        at their location. Inference service will run at the edge.
    - Default Yolo vison model has common object detection
    - User can upload training images, anottate and lable them.
    - Check their dataset metrics, quality, and perform mandatory checks (min qty : 100, dataset : format, etc)
    - Choose the differenct training machine services basic, fast, superfast
    - Train and deploy the model
    - Using our SaaS application, user itself can set the configuration through UI for each lables to perform the desired action when the give object is detected. Eg below for object lable :'FIRE'
        - LABLE_NAME : [FIRE]
        - EVENT: 
            - QTY : ['As Detected', 1, 2, Greter than : 10, Lesser than : 100]
            - QTY_UNIT : ['Single Frame', 'Over 1000 frames']
            - OBJECT_COLOR : ['Any', 'Red' 'Blue']
            - GMT_TIME : ['Between : 8am-5pm', At : 10pm, During : Weekends]
            - ZONE : ['ANY', 'Zone_A', 'Zone_B',' 'ZONE_C' 'ZONE_A and ZONE_C]
            - EXPIRE_TIME : ['None', 1H, 1D, 1W, 1M, 1Y]
        - TRIGGER:
            - Notification : ['Email', Teams, SMS]
                - Mask sub sequent notify : ['Next 10 Mins', 'Next 30 Mins']
            - Show This Metrics in Dashboard : 'TRUE' / 'FALSE'
            - Advanced:
                - Trigger Webhook : ['Webhook URL']
                - Require Data Via API : 'TRUE' / 'FALSE'
                    - User will be given with a API for this label
                    - Data will be sent to the api when ever the event occures
                    - Finally user can give the endpoint to third-part or use them self to trigger
                        thing they want.
                    - Or, we can take this API and trigger/control the customers 
                        hardware/machine  with our own controller
